        "In sequence labelling we have two sequences of equal length: a word sequence $x_{1:l}$ and a tag sequence $y_{1:l}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The word sequence $x_{1:l} = \\langle x_1, \\ldots, x_l \\rangle$, where $l$ is the sequence length, is such that token $x_i$ belongs to a vocabulary $\\mathcal W$ of $V$ known words. \n",
        "\n",
        "The tag sequence $y_{1:l} = \\langle y_1, \\ldots, y_l \\rangle$, where $l$ is the same length as the document $x_{1:l}$, is such that each tag $y_i$ belongs to a vocabulary $\\mathcal T$ of $C$ known tags.\n",
        "\n",
        "As always, our models predict probability distributions, thus, for each position $i$ of $x_{1:l}$, we want to predict a distribution over the $C$ possible tags. A common aspect of most sequence labellers is that we can condition on the document $x_{1:l}$ fully, since we are not interested in learning to generate it (rather, it will always be given to us). As for the tag sequence, it depends, we may want to model the tag independently of one another given $x_{1:l}$, we may want to use some history of previous tags (as in a Markov model), we may want to use all of the already generated tags (as in an autoregressive model). We may even want to use some future tags (leading to a class of models class *conditional random fields*, this class of models is not covered in this course, but it is covered in the 3rd year course on structure prediction).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial we focus on the first option, where we condition on $x_{1:l}$ and model the tags in $y_{1:l}$ independently. \n",
        "\n",
        "Statistically, we will condition on the complete input sequence and on the fact that we are tagging the $i$th word, and predict a Categorical distribution for the $i$th tag:\n",

        "\n",
        "The $C$-dimensional probability vector $\\mathbf f(x_{1:l}, i; \\theta)$ that parameterises the Categorical distribution is the output of a neural network whose trainable parameters are denoted by $\\theta$.\n",
        "\n",
        "This will be an excellent playground for introducing the **Transformer encoder**. We will use it to represent $x_{1:l}$ as $l$ hidden states, from each such hidden state we will predict the Categorical parameter using a simple feed-forward neural net with softmax output.\n",

Since the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. had been published in 2017, the Transformer architecture has continued to beat benchmarks in many domains, most importantly in Natural Language Processing. Transformers with an incredible amount of parameters can generate long, convincing [essays](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/08/robot-wrote-this-article-gpt-3), and opened up new application fields of AI. As the hype of the Transformer architecture seems not to come to an end in the next years, it is important to understand how it works, and have implemented it yourself, which we will do in this notebook.\n",

Firstly, the Master AI at UvA offers many great NLP courses that will take a closer look at the application of the Transformer architecture in NLP ([NLP2](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2020-2021/zoek-vak/vak/79628), [Advanced Topics in Computational Semantics](https://studiegids.uva.nl/xmlpages/page/2020-2021/zoek-vak/vak/80162)). Secondly, assignment 2 takes already a closer look at language generation on character level, on which you could easily apply our transformer architecture. Finally, and most importantly, there is so much more to the Transformer architecture. NLP is the domain the Transformer architecture has been originally proposed for and had the greatest impact on, but it also accelerated research in other domains, recently even [Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929). Thus, we focus here on what makes the Transformer and self-attention so powerful in general. In [Tutorial 15](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial15/Vision_Transformer.html), we will discuss the application of Transformers in Computer Vision.\n",

        "\n",
        "The attention mechanism describes a recent new group of layers in neural networks that has attracted a lot of interest in the past few years, especially in sequence tasks. There are a lot of different possible definitions of \"attention\" in the literature, but the one we will use here is the following: _the attention mechanism describes a weighted average of (sequence) elements with the weights dynamically computed based on an input query and elements' keys_. So what does this exactly mean? The goal is to take an average over the features of multiple elements. However, instead of weighting each element equally, we want to weight them depending on their actual values. In other words, we want to dynamically decide on which inputs we want to \"attend\" more than others. In particular, an attention mechanism has usually four parts we need to specify:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Query**: The query is a feature vector that describes what we are looking for in the sequence, i.e. what would we maybe want to pay attention to.\n",
        "* **Keys**: For each input element, we have a key which is again a feature vector. This feature vector roughly describes what the element is \"offering\", or when it might be important. The keys should be designed such that we can identify the elements we want to pay attention to based on the query.\n",
        "* **Values**: For each input element, we also have a value vector. This feature vector is the one we want to average over.\n",
        "* **Score function**: To rate which elements we want to pay attention to, we need to specify a score function $f_{attn}$. The score function takes the query and a key as input, and output the score/attention weight of the query-key pair. It is usually implemented by simple similarity metrics like a dot product, or a small MLP.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The weights of the average are calculated by a softmax over all score function outputs. Hence, we assign those value vectors a higher weight whose corresponding key is most similar to the query. If we try to describe it with pseudo-math, we can write: \n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\\alpha_i = \\frac{\\exp\\left(f_{attn}\\left(\\text{key}_i, \\text{query}\\right)\\right)}{\\sum_j \\exp\\left(f_{attn}\\left(\\text{key}_j, \\text{query}\\right)\\right)}, \\hspace{5mm} \\text{out} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i \\cdot \\text{value}_i\n",

        "For every word, we have one key and one value vector. The query is compared to all keys with a score function (in this case the dot product) to determine the weights. The softmax is not visualized for simplicity. Finally, the value vectors of all words are averaged using the attention weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most attention mechanisms differ in terms of what queries they use, how the key and value vectors are defined, and what score function is used. The attention applied inside the Transformer architecture is called **self-attention**. In self-attention, each sequence element provides a key, value, and query. For each element, we perform an attention layer where based on its query, we check the similarity of the all sequence elements' keys, and returned a different, averaged value vector for each element. We will now go into a bit more detail by first looking at the specific implementation of the attention mechanism which is in the Transformer case the scaled dot product attention."

        "### Scaled Dot Product Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "The core concept behind self-attention is the scaled dot product attention. Our goal is to have an attention mechanism with which any element in a sequence can attend to any other while still being efficient to compute. The dot product attention takes as input a set of queries $Q\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d_k}$, keys $K\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d_k}$ and values $V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{T\\times d_v}$ where $T$ is the sequence length, and $d_k$ and $d_v$ are the hidden dimensionality for queries/keys and values respectively. For simplicity, we neglect the batch dimension for now. The attention value from element $i$ to $j$ is based on its similarity of the query $Q_i$ and key $K_j$, using the dot product as the similarity metric. In math, we calculate the dot product attention as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The matrix multiplication $QK^T$ performs the dot product for every possible pair of queries and keys, resulting in a matrix of the shape $T\\times T$. Each row represents the attention logits for a specific element $i$ to all other elements in the sequence. On these, we apply a softmax and multiply with the value vector to obtain a weighted mean (the weights being determined by the attention). Another perspective on this attention mechanism offers the computation graph which is visualized below (figure credit - [Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).\n",

        "One aspect we haven't discussed yet is the scaling factor of $1/\\sqrt{d_k}$. This scaling factor is crucial to maintain an appropriate variance of attention values after initialization. Remember that we intialize our layers with the intention of having equal variance throughout the model, and hence, $Q$ and $K$ might also have a variance close to $1$. However, performing a dot product over two vectors with a variance $\\sigma^2$ results in a scalar having $d_k$-times higher variance: \n",

        "\n",
        "If we do not scale down the variance back to $\\sim\\sigma^2$, the softmax over the logits will already saturate to $1$ for one random element and $0$ for all others. The gradients through the softmax will be close to zero so that we can't learn the parameters appropriately. Note that the extra factor of $\\sigma^2$, i.e., having $\\sigma^4$ instead of $\\sigma^2$, is usually not an issue, since we keep the original variance $\\sigma^2$ close to $1$ anyways.\n",

Specifically, given a query, key, and value matrix, we transform those into $h$ sub-queries, sub-keys, and sub-values, which we pass through the scaled dot product attention independently.

        "One crucial characteristic of the multi-head attention is that it is permutation-equivariant with respect to its inputs. This means that if we switch two input elements in the sequence, e.g. $X_1\\leftrightarrow X_2$ (neglecting the batch dimension for now), the output is exactly the same besides the elements 1 and 2 switched. Hence, the multi-head attention is actually looking at the input not as a sequence, but as a set of elements. This property makes the multi-head attention block and the Transformer architecture so powerful and widely applicable! But what if the order of the input is actually important for solving the task, like language modeling? The answer is to encode the position in the input features, which we will take a closer look at later (topic _Positional encodings_ below).\n",

        "Before moving on to creating the Transformer architecture, we can compare the self-attention operation with our other common layer competitors for sequence data: convolutions and recurrent neural networks. Below you can find a table by [Vaswani et al. (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) on the complexity per layer, the number of sequential operations, and maximum path length. The complexity is measured by the upper bound of the number of operations to perform, while the maximum path length represents the maximum number of steps a forward or backward signal has to traverse to reach any other position. The lower this length, the better gradient signals can backpropagate for long-range dependencies. Let's take a look at the table below:\n",

        "$n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the representation dimension and $k$ is the kernel size of convolutions. In contrast to recurrent networks, the self-attention layer can parallelize all its operations making it much faster to execute for smaller sequence lengths. However, when the sequence length exceeds the hidden dimensionality, self-attention becomes more expensive than RNNs. One way of reducing the computational cost for long sequences is by restricting the self-attention to a neighborhood of inputs to attend over, denoted by $r$. Nevertheless, there has been recently a lot of work on more efficient Transformer architectures that still allow long dependencies, of which you can find an overview in the paper by [Tay et al.

        "### Transformer Encoder\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we will look at how to apply the multi-head attention block inside the Transformer architecture. Originally, the Transformer model was designed for machine translation. Hence, it got an encoder-decoder structure where the encoder takes as input the sentence in the original language and generates an attention-based representation. On the other hand, the decoder attends over the encoded information and generates the translated sentence in an autoregressive manner, as in a standard RNN. While this structure is extremely useful for Sequence-to-Sequence tasks with the necessity of autoregressive decoding, we will focus here on the encoder part. Many advances in NLP have been made using pure encoder-based Transformer models (if interested, models include the [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)-family, the [Vision Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), and more), and in our tutorial, we will also mainly focus on the encoder part. If you have understood the encoder architecture, the decoder is a very small step to implement as well. The full Transformer architecture looks as follows (figure credit - [Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)).:\n",

        "\n",
        "The encoder consists of $N$ identical blocks that are applied in sequence. Taking as input $x$, it is first passed through a Multi-Head Attention block as we have implemented above. The output is added to the original input using a residual connection, and we apply a consecutive Layer Normalization on the sum. Overall, it calculates $\\text{LayerNorm}(x+\\text{Multihead}(x,x,x))$ ($x$ being $Q$, $K$ and $V$ input to the attention layer). The residual connection is crucial in the Transformer architecture for two reasons: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Similar to ResNets, Transformers are designed to be very deep. Some models contain more than 24 blocks in the encoder. Hence, the residual connections are crucial for enabling a smooth gradient flow through the model.\n",
        "2. Without the residual connection, the information about the original sequence is lost. Remember that the Multi-Head Attention layer ignores the position of elements in a sequence, and can only learn it based on the input features. Removing the residual connections would mean that this information is lost after the first attention layer (after initialization), and with a randomly initialized query and key vector, the output vectors for position $i$ has no relation to its original input. All outputs of the attention are likely to represent similar/same information, and there is no chance for the model to distinguish which information came from which input element. An alternative option to residual connection would be to fix at least one head to focus on its original input, but this is very inefficient and does not have the benefit of the improved gradient flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Layer Normalization also plays an important role in the Transformer architecture as it enables faster training and provides small regularization. Additionally, it ensures that the features are in a similar magnitude among the elements in the sequence. We are not using Batch Normalization because it depends on the batch size which is often small with Transformers (they require a lot of GPU memory), and BatchNorm has shown to perform particularly bad in language as the features of words tend to have a much higher variance (there are many, very rare words which need to be considered for a good distribution estimate).\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally to the Multi-Head Attention, a small fully connected feed-forward network is added to the model, which is applied to each position separately and identically. Specifically, the model uses a Linear$\\to$ReLU$\\to$Linear MLP. The full transformation including the residual connection can be expressed as:  \n",

        "This MLP adds extra complexity to the model and allows transformations on each sequence element separately.

Usually, the inner dimensionality of the MLP is 2-8$\\times$ larger than $d_{\\text{model}}$, i.e. the dimensionality of the original input $x$. The general advantage of a wider layer instead of a narrow, multi-layer MLP is the faster, parallelizable execution.\n",

        "\n",
        "One commonly used technique for training a Transformer is learning rate warm-up. This means that we gradually increase the learning rate from 0 on to our originally specified learning rate in the first few iterations. Thus, we slowly start learning instead of taking very large steps from the beginning. In fact, training a deep Transformer without learning rate warm-up can make the model diverge and achieve a much worse performance on training and testing. Take for instance the following plot by [Liu et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.03265.pdf) comparing Adam-vanilla (i.e. Adam without warm-up) vs Adam with a warm-up:\n",
        "\n",
        "<center width=\"100%\"><img src=\"https://github.com/phlippe/uvadlc_notebooks/blob/master/docs/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial6/warmup_loss_plot.svg?raw=1\" width=\"350px\"></center>\n",
        "\n",
        "Clearly, the warm-up is a crucial hyperparameter in the Transformer architecture. Why is it so important? There are currently two common explanations. Firstly, Adam uses the bias correction factors which however can lead to a higher variance in the adaptive learning rate during the first iterations. Improved optimizers like [RAdam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03265) have been shown to overcome this issue, not requiring warm-up for training Transformers. Secondly, the iteratively applied Layer Normalization across layers can lead to very high gradients during the first iterations, which can be solved by using [Pre-Layer Normalization](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/328-Paper.pdf) (similar to Pre-Activation ResNet), or replacing Layer Normalization by other techniques ([Adaptive Normalization](https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/328-Paper.pdf), [Power Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07845)). \n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, many applications and papers still use the original Transformer architecture with Adam, because warm-up is a simple, yet effective way of solving the gradient problem in the first iterations. There are many different schedulers we could use. For instance, the original Transformer paper used an exponential decay scheduler with a warm-up. However, the currently most popular scheduler is the cosine warm-up scheduler, which combines warm-up with a cosine-shaped learning rate decay. We can implement it below, and visualize the learning rate factor over epochs. "

        "Finally, we can create a training function similar to the one we have seen in Tutorial 5 for PyTorch Lightning. We create a `pl.Trainer` object, running for $N$ epochs, logging in TensorBoard, and saving our best model based on the validation. Afterward, we test our models on the test set. An additional parameter we pass to the trainer here is `gradient_clip_val`. This clips the norm of the gradients for all parameters before taking an optimizer step and prevents the model from diverging if we obtain very high gradients at, for instance, sharp loss surfaces (see many good blog posts on gradient clipping, like [DeepAI glossary](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/gradient-clipping)). For Transformers, gradient clipping can help to further stabilize the training during the first few iterations, and also afterward. In plain PyTorch, you can apply gradient clipping via `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(...)` (see [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_.html#torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_)). The clip value is usually between 0.5 and 10, depending on how harsh you want to clip large gradients. After having explained this, let's implement the training function:"

        "In this tutorial, we took a closer look at the Multi-Head Attention layer which uses a scaled dot product between queries and keys to find correlations and similarities between input elements. The Transformer architecture is based on the Multi-Head Attention layer and applies multiple of them in a ResNet-like block. The Transformer is a very important, recent architecture that can be applied to many tasks and datasets. Although it is best known for its success in NLP, there is so much more to it. We have seen its application on a sequence labelling tasks. Its property of being permutation-equivariant if we do not provide any positional encodings, allows it to generalize to many settings. Hence, it is important to know the architecture, but also its possible issues such as the gradient problem during the first iterations solved by learning rate warm-up. If you are interested in continuing with the study of the Transformer architecture, please have a look at the blog posts listed at the beginning of the tutorial notebook."
